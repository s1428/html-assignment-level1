        <h2>Save Nature,save creatures</h2>       
        <img src="nature.jpg" alt="nature" width="400" />
        <p>The delicate balance of Nature has been disturbed due to increased population of human beings.
         The activities of mankind have led to decrease in the green cover comprising forest land.
         This has resulted in many wild animals getting extinct or reaching the brink of extinction.
         Increased population results in clearing of forest lands. Encroaching is done for farming, leading to decrease in living space for wild animals.
         Poaching for skins, rhino horns, elephant turks, has led to a decrease in their numbers.  
         Not only has the loss of habitat played havoc but the greed for animal products has caused the dwindling of the species of tigers, rhinoceros, crocodile and many of the birds. This has adversely affected the food chains. 
         There is an urgent need for afforestation and strict implementation of forest laws.
          More wildlife sanctuaries are needed to protect the forest land.
          More voluntary agencies need to be active and work for Gandhiji’s message ‘Nature has enough for men’s need but not for men’s greed.

        <p>The environment is our natural foundation, and we have to take care of it.
         Our environment plays a massive role in the kind of person we grow up to be.
         There are a lot of valid reasons for which we need to save our environment.
         Our environment has suffered significant threats in the last few decades.
         The ever increasing vehicles and pollution have transformed our environment into a mass of smoky mess.
         Enormous corruption has almost stripped it of fresh air. 
        </p>
        <p>Nomadic tribes have practiced shifting ax cultivation that has cost us the valuable fertility of the soil. 
          Due to the rapid growth of factories and industrial sectors, chemicals and smoke are regularly released in water and air.
          This causes water and air pollution. Humans have also neglected their responsibilities and have dumped garbage anywhere they could.
          This leads to land pollution and diseases as insects like flies carry the filth to our bodies and spread harmful viruses.

            <h3>Save Trees</h3>      
            <p>Trees are the most beautiful creatures in nature and needs to be saved.
             With their lush green leaves, they provide natural scenery and a pleasant view to the human eyes.
             But, the current environmental pollution due to human activities has led to the destruction of trees causing a huge scale of deforestation. 
             It’s high time that we understand the importance of trees and save trees.

                <h3>Save Animals</h3>
                <p>Wildlife is a precious gift from God for this planet.
                 The term "fauna" is not only for wild animals but also for all non-domesticated life forms including birds, insects, plants, fungi and even microscopic organisms. 
                 To maintain a healthy ecological balance on this land, animals, plants and marine species are as important as humans.
                 Every organism on this earth has a unique place in the food chain that contributes to the ecosystem in its own way. 
                 But, unfortunately today, many animals and birds are endangered.
